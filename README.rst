==============================
THAT - the Python anti-zen
==============================

Warning: This is a joke. Don't use these bits unless you want to be hated.

Installation
============

At some point this will be packaged up and placed on PyPI. Then you'll be able to just do::

    pip install that

This will happen later, when formal requirements are defined for the operation of the `setup.py` script. In the meantime, just::

    git clone git@github.com:pydanny/that.git

Usage
======

From where you cloned the library:

    cd that
    python

From the Python shell::

    import that

Enjoy the wisdom!

Contributing
============

Clearly, the code that generates `THAT` is too straightforward. If you can make it better, then do so. Just don't do anything like add tests or document the code.
